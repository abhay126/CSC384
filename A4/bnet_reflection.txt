1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network. Explain in 50-100 words.

The above calculations show that our model predictions are favourable to men as comparable to women. There is no demographic parity 
as one can see that our model predicts salaries higher than 50K for men more than women. It is not well separaetd either since 
most of the probabilities become lower if gender is given a proper evidence variable (especially if it is 'Female'). Finally, the model 
already predicts insufficiently accuraately for both men and women whether their salaries are greater than 50K or not. 


2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not? Explain in 50-100 words.

No, I would not recommend using this model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm. Besides the model being not fair,
it also uses facts about the individuals that should not matter like their Race, Gender, Relationship and Marital Status, all of which
should have nothing to do with salaries. These information pieces can create unwanted biases within the model that should not exist
making the model more unfair that it already is.
