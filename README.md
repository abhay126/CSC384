# CSC384
This repo contains my lab solutions for the course CSC384 offered by University of Toronto in 2023 Fall.

Here is a brief description of all 4 four labs.

1) A1: Implemented A* algorithm with manhattan distance heuristic as well as a custom heuristic to solve the Sokoban game with one playable character and boxes of only one colour
2) A2: Implemented game search with alpha-beta pruning to make an AI for playing the mancala game
3) A3: Formed constraints and arcs to solve a kropki sudoku by making it a contraint satisfaction problem
4) A4: Formed a Bayes Network and implemented variable elimination algorithm to analyze a population dataset regarding their workforce, salaries, cultural background and so on
